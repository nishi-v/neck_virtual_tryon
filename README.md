# Necklace Virtual Try-On

## Description

This application allows users to virtually try on necklaces by overlaying selected necklace images onto a captured photo of their neck. The app uses image processing techniques to adjust and align the necklace image based on detected neck coordinates.

## Features

- Select from a list of necklace images.
- Capture an image of your neck using the camera.
- Overlay the selected necklace on the captured image.
- Automatically adjust and align the necklace based on detected neck coordinates.

## Installation
